text_rebel1;This disk appears to contain a fragment of a rebel transmission.  The nature of the transmission isn't clear.  You will need to gather all four parts and combine them in order to determine the contents of the transmission.;Этот диск видимо содержит фрагмент сообщения от повстанцев. Смысл сообщения не ясен. Вам нужно будет собрать все четыре части и объединить их для того, чтобы определить содержание передачи.
text_rebel2;This disk appears to contains partial plans to a new type of Imperial starship.  Unfortunately, the data is incomplete.  The disk's file index indicates there are three more parts to the plans.  If you gather all three of those parts, you should be able to assemble the complete set of plans.;Этот диск видимо содержит частичные планы по новому типу корабля Империи. К сожалению, эти данные неполные. Индексный файл диска указывает еще на три части плана. Если вы собирете все эти три части, у вас будет полный план.
text_imperial1;The disk contains a fragment of orders apparently addressed to a commanding officer of the rebellion.  You aren't able to determine the nature of the orders from this piece alone.  If you gather the other three parts of the message, you should be able to assemble the complete set of orders.;

sys_not_in_inv;The disk can't be used unless it is in your inventory!;

complete_rebel1;The disk contains a transmission from rebel spies that have been operating in Imperial controlled areas.  The spies have provided extensive information on Imperial troop movements and force compositions.  This information is highly valuable to the Rebel Alliance.  If you turn it in to a rebel operative, you might receive a handsome reward.;
complete_rebel2;The disk contains extensive plans on a prototype Imperial starship.  According to the documents, the ship has just recently entered into the preproduction phase and only exists in limited quantities.  If the Rebel Alliance had this information, they might be able to sabotage the prototypes or build ships of similar capability.  If you turn these documents over to a rebel operative, you should get a nice reward.;
complete_imperial1;The disk contains a series of complex orders from a Rebel Alliance commander to his subordinates.  The unit and location code names mean little to you, but the Galactic Empire might be able to act on this information.  You could probably turn this information over to an Imperial operative for a sizable reward.;
response_imperial1_imperial;I don't know how you got this information, but it appears to be real.  My superiors will find this quite informative.  Here is a little something to incentivise further loyalty to the Empire.;
response_imperial1_rebel;How did you get these orders?  Nevermind, I don't want to know.  I understand that you could have given this to the Empire just as easily.  While I would hope you did this out of faith in the Rebellion, I understand that faith doesn't pay debts.;
response_rebel1_imperial;This...information...how...?  Ahem.  The accuracy of the information gathered by these spies is surprising.  I'll make sure this disk disappears immediately.  You could have given this to the Rebels, I imagine.  Thank you for choosing to aid the Empire.;
response_rebel1_rebel;With these troop movement details we should be able to get supplies and people into this sector easily.  Thank you for assisting the Rebellion.  Here is compensation for any losses you took getting us this information.;
response_rebel2_imperial;These plans can't be real.  I'll check the security codes and...ah...well...  It seems these are legitimate after all.  You could be imprisoned just for having seen this.  By law I should have you interrogated.  On the other hand, I wouldn't want information like this to fall into Rebel hands.  Keep quiet and make sure all the copies disappear.;
response_rebel2_rebel;These plans are incredible.  This ship would be capable of...  I should get this to my superiors at once.  If we act quickly, we might be able to destroy the Imperial prototype or build a similar ship.  Thank you for aiding the Rebellion.;
